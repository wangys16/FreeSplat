# pixelSplat

This is the code for **FreeSplat: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting Towards Free-View Synthesis of Indoor Scenes** by David Charatan, Sizhe Li, Andrea Tagliasacchi, and Vincent Sitzmann.

https://github.com/dcharatan/pixelsplat/assets/13124225/de90101e-1bb5-42e4-8c5b-35922cae8f64

## Installation

To get started, follow [pixelSplat](https://github.com/dcharatan/pixelsplat) to create a virtual environment using Python 3.10+:

```bash
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# Install these first! Also, make sure you have python3.11-dev installed if using Ubuntu.
pip install wheel torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If your system does not use CUDA 12.1 by default, see the troubleshooting tips below.

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting</summary>
<br>

The Gaussian splatting CUDA code (`diff-gaussian-rasterization`) must be compiled using the same version of CUDA that PyTorch was compiled with. As of December 2023, the version of PyTorch you get when doing `pip install torch` was built using CUDA 12.1. If your system does not use CUDA 12.1 by default, you can try the following:

- Install a version of PyTorch that was built using your CUDA version. For example, to get PyTorch with CUDA 11.8, use the following command (more details [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)):

```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

- Install CUDA Toolkit 12.1 on your system. One approach (*try this at your own risk!*) is to install a second CUDA Toolkit version using the `runfile (local)` option [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-1-0-download-archive?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=22.04&target_type=runfile_local). When you run the installer, disable the options that install GPU drivers and update the default CUDA symlinks. If you do this, you can point your system to CUDA 12.1 during installation as follows:

```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.1/lib64 pip install -r requirements.txt
# If everything else was installed but you're missing diff-gaussian-rasterization, do:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.1/lib64 pip install git+https://github.com/dcharatan/diff-gaussian-rasterization-modified
```

## Acquiring Datasets

Following [NeRFusion](https://github.com/jetd1/NeRFusion) and [SurfelNeRF](https://github.com/TencentARC/SurfelNeRF), FreeSplat is trained using 100 scenes from [ScanNet](http://www.scan-net.org), and evaluated on ScanNet and [Replica](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Replica-Dataset) datasets.

You can download our preprocessed datasets [here]().

## Acquiring Pre-trained Checkpoints

You can find our pre-trained checkpoints [here]().

## Running the Code

### Training

The main entry point is `src/main.py`. To train FreeSplat on 2-views, 3-views, and FVT settings, you can respectively call:

```bash
python3 -m src.main +experiment=scannet/2views +output_dir=2views
```
```bash
python3 -m src.main +experiment=scannet/3views +output_dir=3views
```
```bash
python3 -m src.main +experiment=scannet/fvt +output_dir=fvt
```
The output will be saved in path ```outputs/***```.


### Evaluation

#### ScanNet

To evaluate pre-trained model on ```N```-views setting, you can call:

```bash
python3 -m src.main +experiment=scannet/[SETTING] mode=test dataset/view_sampler=evaluation checkpointing.load=[PATH_TO_CHECKPOINT] dataset.view_sampler.num_context_views=[N]
```

For example, to evaluate 3-views trained FreeSplat on 10-views setting, you can run:

```bash
python3 -m src.main +experiment=scannet/3views mode=test dataset/view_sampler=evaluation checkpointing.load=[PATH_TO_CHECKPOINT] dataset.view_sampler.num_context_views=10
```

### VS Code Launch Configuration

We provide VS Code launch configurations for easy debugging.

## Camera Conventions

Our extrinsics are OpenCV-style camera-to-world matrices. This means that +Z is the camera look vector, +X is the camera right vector, and -Y is the camera up vector. Our intrinsics are normalized, meaning that the first row is divided by image width, and the second row is divided by image height.

## Figure Generation Code

We've included the scripts that generate tables and figures in the paper. Note that since these are one-offs, they might have to be modified to be run.
